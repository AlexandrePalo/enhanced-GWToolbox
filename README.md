# Enhanced GWToolbox
GWToolbox for GuildWars with extra features

## Extra features
- **Target everything**: allow Toolbox to target any NPC (deads, minipets, invisibles, ...) from the minimap or with an hotkey.
- **Open chest from distance**: allow Toolbox to open a chest further away than close contact.
- **Add enhanced dialog window**: tbd

## Version list
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gwdevhub/GWToolboxpp/releases/tag/6.16_Release">Toolbox 6.16</a></li>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Target all - main dll</li>
      <li>✅ Open chest from distance - plugin ready</li>
      <li>❌ Dialog window - plugin</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

## Remarks
- When possible, each extra feature is added with a plugin. They are easier to maintain and can be loaded / unloaded when you really need them.
- If not possible, the feature is directly added to the main GWToolbox.dll file but needs to be updated for every Toolbox updated.

## Disclaimer
All these features were at some point removed from the official GuildWars Toolbox because either considered outside of the usual GW bounds, or to comply Toolbox maintainers view about the tool. Some of them were never in the main tool.

Thus, some of these extra features could be considered as *unsafe* to use and could eventually lead to a ban, even if no such ban has been recorded so far.
